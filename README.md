# Google-Magenta-Piano-Transformer-Colab
## This is a mirror copy of the fully working and functioning version of Google Magenta Piano Transformer Colab Notebook that Project Los Angeles curates.

***

### [NEW] You can now download both Google Piano Transformers models at the link below if you want to have a local copy/run locally (recommended).

#### NOTE: Piano Transformer models require Python 3.7 + Tensorflow 1 (1.15) + Tensorflow Datasets 3.2.1 so you may need to downgrade/install all these if you do not use it anymore.
